Therefore, we simply write down the probability of a random sequence of length $5$ being $31459$. Because there are $10$ possible digits for each of the five digits, the probability of any sequence of five digits occurring is $left( frac{1}{10} right)^5 = frac{1}{100000}$.  Since the position of the five-digit sequence can start at any of the first $10^5 - 4 = 99996$ positions that allow a five-digit sequence stretching from that point to exist, the total number of times $31459$ appears equals $99996 cdot frac{1}{100000} = 0.99996 approx boxed{1}$.",    "simplifiedSolution":"1"}
