2023-06-04 15:20:36.040 -07:00 [WRN] Failed to parse response: {    "solution": "Multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of the left-hand side of the equation by $2sqrt{3}$, we get $frac{2Asqrt{3B}}{C} = 9 Rightarrow AC = 2Asqrt{3B}$. Dividing both sides by $A$, we get $C = 2sqrt{3B}$. We can substitute this into the original equation, to get $A = 3sqrt{B}$. Thus, we have $A = 3sqrt{B}, B = B, C = 2sqrt{3B}$. Since $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1, we can conclude that $B$ is of the form $3^n cdot p_1^{a_1} cdot p_2^{a_2} cdots p_k^{a_k}$, where $n$ is either $0$ or $1$, and $p_1, p_2, dots, p_k$ are distinct primes. Since $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, we can further deduce that $A = 3 cdot p_1^{b_1} cdot p_2^{b_2} cdots p_k^{b_k}$ and $C = 2 cdot 3^{n/2} cdot p_1^{c_1} cdot p_2^{c_2} cdots p_k^{c_k}$, where $b_i$ and $c_i$ are non-negative integers for each $i={1,2,cdots,k}$. Now, we can simplify the expression for $A+B+C$ as follows:nn$$A+B+C = 3 cdot p_1^{b_1} cdot p_2^{b_2} cdots p_k^{b_k} + 3^n cdot p_1^{a_1} cdot p_2^{a_2} cdots p_k^{a_k} + 2 cdot 3^{n/2} cdot p_1^{c_1} cdot p_2^{c_2} cdots p_k^{c_k}$$nSince $n$ is either $0$ or $1$, the term $3^n$ can be written as $3^0$ or $3^1$. Depending on the value of $n$, we get two cases:nn$Case$ $1$: If $n=0$, we have $B = p_1^{a_1} cdot p_2^{a_2} cdots p_k^{a_k}$, and $C = 2sqrt{3B} = 2 cdot 3^{1/2} cdot p_1^{a_1/2} cdot p_2^{a_2/2} cdots p_k^{a_k/2}$. Therefore, $A = 3sqrt{B} = 3 cdot p_1^{a_1/2} cdot p_2^{a_2/2} cdots p_k^{a_k/2}$, and we get:nn$$A+B+C = 3 cdot p_1^{a_1/2} cdot p_2^{a_2/2} cdots p_k^{a_k/2} + p_1^{a_1} cdot p_2^{a_2} cdots p_k^{a_k} + 2 cdot 3^{1/2} cdot p_1^{a_1/2} cdot p_2^{a_2/2} cdots p_k^{a_k/2}$$nSimplifying this expression, we get:nn$$A+B+C = (3+2sqrt{3}) cdot p_1^{a_1/2} cdot p_2^{a_2/2} cdots p_k^{a_k/2} + p_1^{a_1} cdot p_2^{a_2} cdots p_k^{a_k}$$nSince $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, we know that $p_1, p_2, dots, p_k$ are not equal to 3 (since $C$ contains a factor of $3^{1/2}$). Therefore, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator of the first term by $3^{1/2}$ to obtain a conjugate of $3+2sqrt{3}$, which we can then simplify. Specifically:nn$$(3+2sqrt{3})

From the given information, we know that p + l + s = 24, p + l = 2s, and p + s = l. We can use substitution to solve for p. First, we can rewrite the second equation as l = 2s - p, and then substitute that into the third equation to get p + s = 2s - p. Solving for p, we get p = s/2. Substituting that into the first equation gives us s/2 + l + s = 24, or l = 24 - 1.5s. Now we can substitute both of those into the second equation to get p + (24 - 1.5s) = 2s, which simplifies to p = 3s/4 - 8. Finally, we can substitute back into the first equation to solve for s: s/2 + (24 - 1.5s) + s = 24, which gives us s = 8. Plugging that back into our equation for p, we get p = 2.

2023-06-04 21:33:54.684 -07:00 [WRN] Failed to parse response: {    "solution": "We start by multiplying both sides by $C$ and $frac{sqrt{3}}{3}$ to get rid of the fraction and simplify: $Asqrt{B} = frac{9Csqrt{3}}{2sqrt{3}} = frac{9}{2}C$. Squaring both sides gives $AB = (frac{9}{2}C)^2 = frac{81}{4}C^2$. Since $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1, $B$ must be equal to $frac{4}{9}$ times a perfect square, say $B = frac{4}{9}D^2$ for some positive integer $D$. Substituting this into our equation gives $Acdotfrac{2}{3}D = Ccdotfrac{3}{2}D$. Since $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, $A$ must divide $frac{3}{2}D$ and $C$ must divide $frac{2}{3}D$. Thus, $frac{3}{2}D$ and $frac{2}{3}D$ must both be divisible by $P$, the product of all the prime factors of $A$ and $C$. The only prime factor they can share is 2, so 2 must divide $P$. Also, $frac{3}{2}$ and $frac{2}{3}$ are not divisible by 3, so $P$ cannot include 3 as a factor. Therefore, $P$ must be equal to 2. Let $A = 2E$ and $C = 2F$, where $E$ and $F$ are positive integers. Then we have $frac{3}{2}D = ED = 3FD = frac{2}{3}D$. Solving, we get $E = frac{2}{3}D$ and $F = frac{3}{2}D$. Substituting these back into our equation gives $2Esqrt{frac{4}{9}D^2} = 2FD$, which simplifies to $16D^3 = 36EF^2$. Since $P$ cannot include 3 as a factor, $D$ must be divisible by 3. Let $D = 3G$, where $G$ is a positive integer. Substituting this back into our equation gives $8G^3 = 9EF^2$. Since $P$ can only include 2 as a factor, $G$ must be even. Let $G = 2H$, where $H$ is a positive integer. Substituting this back again gives $32H^3 = 9EF^2$. Since $P$ can only include 2 as a factor, $F$ must be even. Let $F = 2I$, where $I$ is a positive integer. Substituting this back again gives $32H^3 = 36EI^2$, or equivalently, $8H^3 = 9EI^2$. Since $P$ can only include 2 as a factor, $E$ must be even. Let $E = 2J$, where $J$ is a positive integer. Substituting this back one final time gives $2H^3 = 9JI^2$. Since $H$ is even, let $H = 2K$, where $K$ is a positive integer. Substituting this back gives $16K^3 = 9JI^2$. Since $16$ and $9$ are relatively prime, $J$ must be a perfect cube and $I$ must be a perfect square. Let $J = L^3$ and $I = M^2$, where $L$ and $M$ are positive integers. Substituting these back gives $16K^3 = 9L^3M^4$. Since $16$ and $9$ are relatively prime, $L$ must be a multiple of 16 and $M$ must be a multiple of 9. Let $L = 16N$ and $M = 9P$, where $N$ and $P$ are positive integers. Substituting these back one final time gives $16K^3 = 16^3cdot 9N^3cdot 9^2P^4 = 2^8cdot 3^5cdot N^3cdot P^4$. Thus, $K^3 = 3^2cdot 2^5cdot N^3cdot P^4$. Since $K$ is even, $K$ must be a multiple of 4. Let $K = 4Q$, where $Q$ is a positive integer. Sub
