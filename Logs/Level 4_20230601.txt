We are given $a/b+c/d=11/12$ and $ac/bd=1/6$.  Rearranging the first equation yields $ad/bd+bc/bd=11/12$, which is equivalent to $(ad+bc)/bd=11/12$.  Notice that $ad+bc$ is the numerator of $a/b+c/d$, which is $11$, so we have $11/bd=11/12$, which implies $bd=12$.  Thus $b$ and $d$ are divisors of $12$ and we have the following options:[4pt]Option 1: $b=1$ and $d=12$Option 2: $b=2$ and $d=6$Option 3: $b=3$ and $d=4$Option 4: $b=4$ and $d=3$Option 5: $b=6$ and $d=2$Option 6: $b=12$ and $d=1$[4pt]For each option, we can solve for $a$ and $c$ using the equation $ac/bd=1/6$ and the fact that $gcd(a,b)=gcd(c,d)=1$.  Simplifying $ac/bd=1/6$ yields $ac=bd/6$, so $a=(bd/6)/c$.  Substituting $bd=12$ and solving for $a$ in terms of $c$ yields $a=2c$.  Substituting this expression for $a$ into $gcd(a,b)=1$ yields $gcd(2c,b)=1$.  Similarly, substituting $c=(bd/6)/a$ yields $c=2a$, so $gcd(c,d)=gcd(2a,12)=gcd(a,6)=1$.  Thus $a$ and $b$ must be of the form $2x$ and $y$, respectively, where $xy=bd=12$.  Substituting these expressions into $ac/bd=1/6$ yields $(2x)(4y)/12=1/6$, so $8xy=12$.  Since $xy=12$, we have $8xy=96neq12$, which means there are no solutions in this case.[4pt]We can quickly eliminate Option 6 because both $a$ and $b$ would be $12$, which would make their sum greater than $11/12$.[4pt]We can also eliminate Option 5 because if $b=6$ and $d=2$, then $a/b$ and $c/d$ are both greater than $1/2$ and their sum is greater than $11/12$.[4pt]Trying the remaining options, we get the following results:[4pt]Option 1: $b=1$ and $d=12$.  We have $a+12c=11$ and $ac=1$.  From the first equation, $a=11-12c$, so substituting into the second equation yields $c(11-12c)=1$, which simplifies to $-12c^2+11c+1=0$.  Factoring this quadratic yields $(-3c+1)(4c+1)=0$.  The solutions $c=1/3$ and $c=-1/4$ both lead to valid values of $a$, namely $a=35/3$ and $a=-29/4$.  We need to determine which solution gives the lesser of the two fractions.  Since $a/b+c/d=11/12$, we have $a/b=(11/12)-c/d$.  Using this expression, we find that $a/b=16/36=4/9$ if $c=1/3$ and $a/b=-41/48$ if $c=-1/4$.  Thus the lesser of the two fractions is $boxed{frac{4}{9}}$.[4pt]Option 2: $b=2$ and $d=6$.  We have $2a+6c=11$ and $ac=1$.  From the first equation, $a=(11-6c)/2$, so substituting into the second equation yields $c(11-6c)/2=1$, which simplifies to $-3c^2+11c/2+1=0$.  This quadratic has solutions $c=2/3$ and $c=1/

We have the equations $ad+bc=11bd/12$ and $ac=bd/6$.  Since $bd$ is not equal to zero, we can solve for $c$ in the second equation and substitute it into the first to get $ad+2ab=11ab/2$, which simplifies to $ad=9ab/2$.  Thus, $c=frac{bd}{6a}$.  Substituting this into the equation $ad+bc=11bd/12$, we have $ad+b^2d/6a=11bd/12$.  Rearranging, we have $a^2d+2b^2=11abd/3$.  Since $a$, $b$, and $d$ are integers, $a^2d$ is divisible by $3$, so $3$ divides $a$.  Let $a=3m$ for some integer $m$, then we have $9md^2+2b^2=11mbd/3$, which implies that $b^2$ is divisible by $3$.  Thus, $b$ is divisible by $3$.  Let $b=3n$ for some integer $n$. Then the original equations become $3m(d+2n)=11dn/4$ and $m^2d+2n^2=11mn/3$.  Since $3$ divides $d+2n$, we have $3$ divides $11dn/4$, so $3$ divides $n$.  Let $n=3p$ for some integer $p$. Then the equations become $m(d+6p)=11dp/4$ and $m^2d+18p^2=11mp$.  Since $3$ divides $d+6p$, we have $3$ divides $11dp/4$, so $3$ divides $p$.  Let $p=3q$ for some integer $q$.  Then the equations become $m(d+18q)=11dq/4$ and $m^2d+162q^2=11mq$.  Since $3$ divides $d+18q$, we have $3$ divides $11dq/4$, so $3$ divides $q$.  Let $q=3r$ for some integer $r$.  Then the equations become $m(d+54r)=33dr$ and $m^2d+1458r^2=33mr$.  Since $3$ divides $d+54r$, we have $3$ divides $33dr$, so $3$ divides $r$.  Let $r=3s$ for some integer $s$.  Then the equations become $m(d+162s)=11ds$ and $m^2d+1458s^2=11ms$.  Since $3$ divides $d+162s$, we have $3$ divides $11ds$, so $3$ divides $s$.  Let $s=3t$ for some integer $t$.  Then the equations become $m(d+486t)=121dt$ and $m^2d+13122t^2=121mt$.  Since $3$ divides $d+486t$, we have $3$ divides $121dt$, so $3$ divides $t$.  Let $t=3u$ for some integer $u$.

From the problem statement, we have the system of equations: $$frac{a}{b}+frac{c}{d}=frac{11}{12}$$  $$frac{ac}{bd}=frac{1}{6}$$  From the second equation, we have $ac=bd/6$. Since $b$ and $d$ are both integers, this implies that 6 divides at least one of $a$ and $c$.  Without loss of generality, assume that 6 divides $a$, so $a=6m$ for some integer $m$.  Substituting into the equation $ac=bd/6$ and simplifying gives $3m(c)=bd$. From the first equation, we can rewrite $frac{c}{d}$ in terms of $frac{a}{b}$ to obtain $$frac{a}{b}+frac{c}{d}=frac{a}{b}+frac{bd/3}{d}=frac{a+bd/3}{b}=frac{11}{12}$$ Cross-multiplying and simplifying gives $12a+4bd=11b^2$. We can substitute $3m(c)$ for $bd$ to obtain $12a+4cdot3m(c)=11b^2$, which simplifies to $4a+3mc=frac{11}{4}b^2$. Since $3mc$ is divisible by 3, this implies that $4a$ is divisible by 3, which means that $a$ is divisible by 3. Thus, we have $a=3p$ for some integer $p$. Substituting this into the equation $4a+3mc=frac{11}{4}b^2$ and simplifying gives $$b^2=frac{48p+9m}{11}$$ Since the right-hand side is an integer, this means that $11$ divides $48p+9m$, which implies that $3$ divides $m$. We can substitute $3n$ for $m$ to obtain $$b^2=frac{48p+27n}{11}$$ We know that $b^2$ is an integer, so this implies that $11$ divides $48p+27n$. Thus, $3$ divides $48p+27n$, which implies that $3$ divides $16p+9n$. Since $n$ is a multiple of 3, this means that $p$ is also a multiple of 3. We can substitute $3q$ for $p$ to obtain $$b^2=frac{144q+27n}{11}$$ Since $11$ does not divide $n$, this implies that $11$ divides $144q$, which implies that $11$ divides $q$. Thus, we can substitute $11r$ for $q$ to obtain $$b^2=frac{1584r+27n}{11}$$ Since $11$ divides $27n$, this implies that $11$ divides $1584r$, which implies that $11$ divides $144r$. Thus, $11$ divides $r$, so we can substitute $11s$ for $r$ to obtain $$b^2=frac{17424s+27n}{11}$$ Since $11$ does not divide $n$, this implies that $11$ divides $17424s$, which implies that $11$ divides $1584s$. Thus, $11$ divides $144s$, which implies that $11$ divides $s$. Therefore, we can substitute $11t$ for $s$ to obtain $$b^2=frac{191664t+27n}{11}$$ Since $11$ divides $27n$, this implies that $11$ divides $191664t$, which implies that $11$ divides $17424t$. Thus, $11$ divides $1584t$, which implies that $11$ divides $t$. Therefore, we can substitute $11u$ for $t$ to obtain $$b^2=frac{2102400u+27n}{11}$$ Since $11$ does not divide $n$, this implies that $11$ divides $2102400u$, which implies that $11$ divides $191040u$. Thus, $11$ divides $1744u$, which implies that $11$ divides $158u$. Therefore, $11$ divides $14u$, which implies that $11$ divides $u$. Since $u$ is a positive integer, this means that $ugeq11$.

Hence, $f=2g$ for some positive integer $g$, so $$a+frac{g}{frac{d}{2}}=frac{11}{12}.$$Since $d$ is odd, it follows that $frac{d}{2}$ is an integer, so we can apply the Euclidean algorithm to $g$ and $frac{d}{2}$ to obtain $$a+frac{g}{frac{d}{2}}=a+frac{2}{frac{d}{2}/(g,frac{d}{2})}=frac{11}{12}.$$Since $a$ is an integer, it follows that $frac{2}{frac{d}{2}/(g,frac{d}{2})}$ is a fraction with denominator divisible by $3$.  Since $11$ is not divisible by $3$, it follows that $frac{2}{frac{d}{2}/(g,frac{d}{2})}$ is a fraction with denominator divisible by $4$.  Since $11$ is not divisible by $4$, it follows that $frac{2}{frac{d}{2}/(g,frac{d}{2})}$ is a fraction with denominator divisible by $6$.

If $a=0$, then $$frac{k}{d}=frac{11}{12},$$which is impossible.  Hence, $a=1$, so $$frac{1}{b}+frac{2g}{d}=frac{11}{12}.$$Multiplying both sides by $12bd$, we have $$12d+24bg=11bd.$$Since $2$ divides $d$, it follows that $2$ divides $bd$, so $2$ divides $12d+24bg$, which implies that $2$ divides $g$.

This gives us the system of equations [begin{aligned} 12ad+12bc&=11bd,  2ac&=bd. end{aligned}] Since $2ac=bd$, we know that $bd$ is a multiple of $2$, so $b$ and $d$ must both be even.  Let $b=2b'$ and $d=2d'$.  Substituting these values into the first equation, we get [3ad+3bc'=11b'd'.] Since $b'$ and $d'$ are integers, $11b'd'$ is a multiple of $3$, so $b'd'$ must be a multiple of $3$.  Since $b$ and $d$ are both even, $b'd'$ is a multiple of $4$.  Thus, $b'd'$ is a multiple of both $3$ and $4$, so $b'd'$ is a multiple of $12$.  Let $b'd'=12k$.  Then $b'=3k$ and $d'=k$, so $b=6k$ and $d=2k$.  Substituting these values into the second equation, we get [ac=3k^2.] Since $ac$ is a multiple of $3$, we know that $a$ and $c$ must both be multiples of $3$.  Let $a=3a'$ and $c=3c'$.  Substituting these values into the first equation, we get [9a'd+9b'c'=22b'd'.] Since $b'$ and $d'$ are integers, $22b'd'$ is a multiple of $9$, so $b'd'$ must be a multiple of $3$.  Since $d$ is a multiple of $2$ but not $4$, $d'$ must be an odd integer.  Thus, $b'$ must be a multiple of $3$.  Let $b'=3m$.  Then $d'=2n+1$ for some integer $n$, so $d=4n+2$.  Substituting these values into the second equation, we get [9a'c'=2m(2n+1).] Since $a'$ and $c'$ are integers, $2m(2n+1)$ is a multiple of $9$, so $m$ must be a multiple of $3$.  Let $m=3p$.  Then $b'=9p$, $d=8n+4$, and $ac=27p(2n+1)/3=18pn+9p$.  Since $ac=3a'c'$, we know that $a'c'$ is a multiple of $6$.  Since $a'$ and $c'$ are integers, one of them must be a multiple of $3$ and the other must be a multiple of $2$.  Without loss of generality, let $a'$ be a multiple of $3$ and $c'$ be a multiple of $2$.  Let $a'=3q$ and $c'=2r$.  Then $ac=6qr$, so $6qr=18pn+9p=9p(2n+1)$.  Since $p$ is a multiple of $3$, we know that $9p$ divides the right-hand side of this equation.  Since $2n+1$ is odd, we know that $2n+1$ is relatively prime to $9$, so $9p$ divides $6qr$.  Since $p$ is relatively prime to $6$, we know that $3$ divides $qr$.  Since $a$ is a multiple of $9$ and $c$ is a multiple of $2$, we know that $a/b<c/d$, so $3q/9p<2r/9p$, which implies $q<6r$.  Since $q$ and $r$ are both positive integers, we have $qle 6r-1$.  Thus, $qrle (6r-1)r=r(6r-1)$.  Since $3$ divides $qr$, we know that $3$ divides $r$ or $3

Clearing denominators, we get $12(ad+bc)=11bd$ and $6ad=bc$. Since $6ad=bc$, we have $ad$ is a multiple of $b$ and $c$, which means $ad$ is a multiple of $bd$. Since $ad$ is a multiple of $bd$ and $6ad=bc$, we have $6$ divides $c$. Since $6$ divides $c$, we can write $c=6k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting $c=6k$ into $6ad=bc$, we get $ad=bk$. Since $ad$ is a multiple of $b$ and $c=6k$, we have $a$ is a multiple of $6$. Let $a=6m$ for some integer $m$. Substituting $a=6m$ and $c=6k$ into $12(ad+bc)=11bd$, we get $12(6mb+6kb)=11bd$, which simplifies to $2m+2k=11d/6$. Since $2m+2k$ is even, $11d/6$ must be even, which means $d$ is even. Let $d=2n$ for some integer $n$. Substituting $d=2n$ into $6ad=bc$, we get $3am=bn$. Since $b$ and $n$ are integers, $am$ must be a multiple of $2$. Since $a=6m$, $am$ is a multiple of $6$. Since $3am=bn$, $bn$ is a multiple of $6$. Since $b$ is an integer, $b$ must be a multiple of $2$. Thus, $a$ is a multiple of $6$ and $b$ is a multiple of $2$. Let $a=6m$ and $b=2p$ for some integers $m$ and $p$. Substituting $a=6m$ and $b=2p$ into $6ad=bc$, we get $9m=pn$. Since $p$ and $n$ are integers, $m$ must be a multiple of $n$. Let $m=kn$ for some integer $k$. Substituting $m=kn$ into $a=6m$ and $b=2p$, we get $a=6kn$ and $b=2p$. Thus, the two fractions are $6kn/2p$ and $6k/2n$. Since $k$ and $n$ are integers, $6kn/2p$ and $6k/2n$ are both fractions in lowest terms. We have $6kn/2p+6k/2n=11/12$, which simplifies to $3kn/p+k/n=11/24$. Multiplying both sides by $np$, we get $3k^2n+pk^2=11np/24$. Since $p$ and $n$ are even, $np$ is divisible by $4$. Thus, $11np/24$ is an integer, which means $3k^2n+pk^2$ is divisible by $4$. Since $k$ is odd, $k^2$ is odd, which means $3k^2n$ is odd. Thus, $pk^2$ must be divisible by $4$. Since $p$ is even, $k^2$ must be divisible by $4$. Thus, $k$ is divisible by $2$. Let $k=2q$ for some integer $q$. Substituting $k=2q$ into $3k^2n+pk^2=11np/24$, we get $12q^2n+2pq^2=11np/3$. Since $q$ is even, $q^2$ is divisible by $4$. Thus, $12q^2n$ is divisible by $4$. Since $p$ is even, $pk^2$ is divisible by $8$. Thus, $2pq^2$ is divisible by $8$. Since $11np/3$ is not divisible by $2$, $11np/3$ is not divisible by $8$. Thus, $12q^2n$ must be divisible by $8$. Since $q$ is even, $q^2$ is divisible by $4$, which means $q^2n$ is divisible by $2$. Thus, $n$ is even. Let $n=2r$ for some integer

We have $a/b+c/d=11/12$ and $ac/bd=1/6$. Clearing denominators, we have $12(ad+bc)=11bd$ and $6ad=bc$. Since $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are positive integers, $ad$ and $bc$ are positive integers. Thus, we have $ad+bc$ and $bd$ are both positive integers, and $12(ad+bc)=11bd$ implies that $bd$ is divisible by $12$. Since $6ad=bc$, $bc$ is divisible by $6$, so $bd$ is divisible by $6$. Thus, $bd$ is divisible by $operatorname{lcm}(6,12)=12$, so we can write $bd=12n$ for some positive integer $n$. Then $6ad=bc=12n$, so $ad=2n$. Since $ad$ is even, $a$ and $d$ are both even or both odd. If $a$ and $d$ are both even, then $ad$ is divisible by $4$, but $ad=2n$ is not divisible by $4$, contradiction. Thus, $a$ and $d$ are both odd. If $b$ and $c$ are both odd, then $bc$ is odd, but $bc=12n$ is even, contradiction. Thus, $b$ and $c$ are both even. We can then write $a=2p+1$, $b=2q$, $c=2r$, and $d=2s+1$ for some nonnegative integers $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$. Substituting into $12(ad+bc)=11bd$, we have $(2p+1)(2s+1)+6r(2q)=11q(2s+1)$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $4ps+2p+4sq+2s+6qr=r+11qs$. Rearranging, we get $r(6q-1)=2p+2s-4ps-2q-2s$. Since $r$ is even and $6q-1$ is odd, the left-hand side is even and the right-hand side is even, so $2p+2s-4ps-2q-2s$ is even. Thus, $p+s-2ps-q$ is even. Since $p+s-2ps$ is even, $q$ must be even. Thus, $b=2q$ is the lesser of the two fractions. Substituting $bd=12n$, we have $q(2s+1)=6n$, so $q$ is a factor of $6n$. Since $q$ is even, $q$ is a factor of $3n$. Since $bd=12n$, $b$ is a factor of $12n$. Thus, $b$ is a factor of both $3n$ and $4n$, so $b$ is a factor of $gcd(3n,4n)=n$. Thus, $b$ is a factor of $n$ and $bd=12n$, so $d=12/b$. Since $a/b+c/d=11/12$, we have $a/b+(c/b)/(d/b)=11/12$, so $a/b+c/b=11/12-1=1/12$. Thus, $a/b$ and $c/b$ are the roots of the quadratic $x^2-(a/b+c/b)x+(ac/b^2)=0$. By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is $ac/b^2=1/6b^2$. Since $b$ is a factor of $n$, $b$ is a factor of $6n$, so $1/6b^2$ is the reciprocal of a square of an integer. Thus, $a/b$ and $c/b$ are the roots of $x^2-x/k+1/(6k^2)=0$ for some positive integer $k$. By the quadratic formula, the roots are $x=(1/kpmsqrt{1-4/(6k^2)})/2=(1pmsqrt{k^2-2})/k$. Since $a/b<c/b$, we have $(1-sqrt{k^2-2})/k<1/k$, so $1-sqrt{k^2-2}<1$, which implies $sqrt{k^2-2}>0$. Thus, $k^2>2$, so $kge2$. Since $a/b

We have the system of equations: begin{align*}frac{a}{b}+frac{c}{d}&=frac{11}{12} frac{ac}{bd}&=frac{1}{6}end{align*} We can rewrite the first equation as $frac{ad}{bd}+frac{bc}{bd}=frac{11}{12}$, which gives us $frac{ad+bc}{bd}=frac{11}{12}$. Since $frac{ad}{bd}+frac{bc}{bd}=frac{a}{b}+frac{c}{d}$, we have $frac{a}{b}+frac{c}{d}=frac{11}{12}$, so $frac{ad+bc}{bd}=frac{a}{b}+frac{c}{d}$. We can substitute $frac{1}{6}$ for $frac{ac}{bd}$ in the second equation to get $frac{1}{6}=frac{ac}{bd}$. Cross-multiplying gives us $bd=6ac$. We can substitute $bd=6ac$ into the first equation to get $frac{ad+bc}{6ac}=frac{11}{12}$. Multiplying both sides by $12$ and simplifying gives us $2ad+2bc=11ac$. We can substitute $bd=6ac$ into this equation to get $2ad+2bc=11bd$. We can solve for $b$ in terms of $a$ in the equation $frac{a}{b}+frac{c}{d}=frac{11}{12}$ to get $b=frac{12ad}{11a+12c}$. We can substitute this expression for $b$ into the equation $bd=6ac$ to get $frac{12ad}{11a+12c}d=6ac$. Simplifying gives us $d=frac{66ac}{11a+12c}$. We can substitute these expressions for $b$ and $d$ into the equation $2ad+2bc=11bd$ to get $2a^2d+2ac^2=11a^2c+12abc$. Dividing both sides by $2ac$ gives us $a+d=frac{11a}{2c}+frac{6b}{c}$. We can substitute $frac{12ad}{11a+12c}$ for $b$ and $frac{66ac}{11a+12c}$ for $d$ to get $a+frac{66a^2}{22ac}+frac{72a^2}{22ac}=frac{11a}{2c}+frac{6cdot 12ad}{c(11a+12c)}$. Simplifying gives us $a(11a^2+792ac-792ac)=33a^2c(11a+12c)$, which simplifies to $11a^3=33a^3c+36ac^2$. Dividing both sides by $11a^3$ gives us $1=3c+frac{36c^2}{11a^2}$. Since $c$ and $a$ are integers, $frac{36c^2}{11a^2}$ must be a positive integer. The only way this can happen is if $a=1$ and $c=2$. Substituting $a=1$ and $c=2$ into the equation $1=3c+frac{36c^2}{11a^2}$ gives us $1=3cdot 2+frac{36cdot 2^2}{11cdot 1^2}$, so $1=frac{25}{11}+frac{8}{11}$, which is true. Therefore, $a=1$ and $c=2$. We can substitute $a=1$ and $c=2$ into the equation $frac{a}{b}+frac{c}{d}=frac{11}{12}$ to get $frac{1}{b}+frac{2}{d}=frac{11}{12}$. We can substitute $bd=6ac=12$ into this equation to get $2b+d=frac{22bd}{12}$. Solving for $d$ gives us $d=frac{22b}{3}-4$. We can substitute $d=frac{22b}{3}-4$ into the equation $frac{ac}{bd}=frac{1}{6}$ to get $frac{a}{b}cdotfrac{c}{

This means $(x,y)$ must lie on the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting $(6,-20)$ and $(1,14)$.  The midpoint of this segment is $M=left(frac{7}{2}, -3right)$, so the perpendicular bisector has equation $x = frac{7}{2}$.  Any point $(x,y)$ on this line satisfies $y-2 = k(x-frac{7}{2})$ for some constant $k$.  We want this point to also satisfy $dleft((x,y), (6,-20)right) = dleft((x,y), (1,14)right)$, where $d(u,v)$ denotes the Euclidean distance between $u$ and $v$. Expanding this equation (and reordering independent terms) yields $(30-4x)x + 284 - 28y = 0$.  Solving for $y$ in terms of $x$ (using the equation for the perpendicular bisector) gives $y=-k(x-tfrac{7}{2})+2$. Substituting this into $(30-4x)x + 284 - 28y = 0$ yields the quadratic $(5x-29)(2x-11)=0$, whose solutions are $11/2$ and $29/5$.  (The quadratic factors because it turns out that $(6,-20)$ and $(1,14)$ lie "horizontally" during the walk.)  Since $2<29/5$, the point of intersection of the perpendicular bisector and the line $y=2$ lies at $(5.8,2)$.  Thus the distance to Charlie is $sqrt{left(5.8-7/2right)^2 + (0)^2} approx 1.871$ units.  It follows that Annie and Barbara travel the same vertical distance upward as this amount, which brings them from a $y$-coordinate of $-20$ to around $-18.13$.

The $frac{7}{2}$ is between the $x$-coordinates of both $A$ and $B$, so the closest point that is equidistant is on the line $x=frac{7}{2}$.  Thus, the Walk Upwards Together point will also have $x$-coordinate $frac{7}{2}$.  Therefore, let the Walk Upwards Together point be $left(frac{7}{2},wright)$, so by symmetry $AM=BM=|-3-(-20)|=17$, and $w-2$ is the length of their combined walk. The distance formula shows the equation $(x-6)^2+(y+20)^2=(x-1)^2+(y-14)^2$.

Simplify the right-hand side of the bottom equation using the difference of squares factorization:n$$frac{1}{6} = frac{ac}{bd} = left(frac{a+c}{b}right)cdot left(frac{a-c}{d}right)$$Since $11/2$ is not a fraction in lowest terms but the final equation must be, we must break up the products into pieces such that the piece of $11/2$ isn't there:$$frac{1}{6} = left(frac{2a+2c}{2b}right)cdot frac{a-c}{3d}implies a + c = 11b/4 quadtext{ and }quad 3d(a-c) = 2b.$$Since $3d$ divides $2b$, we know that $5$ divides $b$, so $b = 5n$.  Factoring a $5$ out of the equation $3d(a-c) = 2b$, we get $3d(a-c) = (10n)$. Since $3$ divides the left-hand side but does not divide $(10n)$, it must divide $a-c$. Write $a-c = 3m$. Substitution of $11b/4$ for $a+c$ in $3d(a-c) = 2b$ gives $33dn = 10bn - 60dm$. Cancelling out factors of $n$, we have $33d = 10b - 20m$.  From $a+c = 11b/4$, we can see $a+c$ is not an integer (since $b$ is even). As $a-c = 3m$, this also eliminates the possibility of $a-c$ being nonintegral. As $d$, $b$, $n$, and $m$ are integers, $10b-20m$ is always even, implying $33d$ is even, and that $d$ is even.If $d=2$, solving $3d(a-c)=2b$ and $a+c=11b/4$ shows that $b$ must be even and a multiple of $8$. Therefore, we try this value of $b$ (namely $b=8$). We derive $d=2$, $m=1$, and $n=1$, which correspond to $a+c=22$ and $a-c=3$. Addition of our equations shows $2a=25$; hence, $a=frac{25}{2}         .    $ Substituting $(a,b,d,c)$ into $a/b+c/d = 11/12$ yields a final answer of $a/c=boxed{17/20}$.
