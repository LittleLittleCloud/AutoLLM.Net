Equating this with $3x^2 + 14x + 8$, we get $A + 3B = 14$ and $AB = 8$. We need to find $A - B$, which can be written as $(A + 3B) - 4B$. From the first equation, we get $A = 14 - 3B$. Substituting in the second equation, we get $B^2 - 4B + 8 = 0$. Solving for $B$, we get $B = 2 + sqrt{2}$ or $B = 2 - sqrt{2}$. Substituting each value of $B$ into $A = 14 - 3B$, we get $A = 8 - 3sqrt{2}$ or $A = 8 + 3sqrt{2}$. Finally, $A - B = (8 + 3sqrt{2}) - (2 + sqrt{2}) = 6 + 2sqrt{2}$ or $(8 - 3sqrt{2}) - (2 - sqrt{2}) = 6 - 2sqrt{2}$.

But each of the sums a+e+g, d+e+h, b+f+g, c+f+h appears twice among the sums of pairs of numbers in the four interior squares; so the sum of these three sums is three times the sum of all eight numbers,n$$3(a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h) = 3(2+3+4+ldots+9) = 3cdot 44 = 132,$$ and it follows that $b+c+d+e+f+g+h=44$.nTherefore, the common sum is $$(a+b)+(c+d)+(e+g)+(f+h) =2(a+b+c+d)-(b+c+d+e+f+g+h)=2(a+b+c+d)-44.$$ Since $2+3+4+dots+9=44$,  we have that $a+b+c+d=20+5+6+7=boxed{38}$.",    "simplifiedSolution":"38"}

The revenue is $2.75n$, and the cost is $1000 + (problem/100) cdot n$, since it costs $${problem}.50$ per widget. In order to make a profit, the revenue must be greater than the cost, so we have the inequality $$2.75n > 1000 + (problem/100) cdot n.$$Solving for $n$, we get $$n > frac{1000}{2.75 - problem/100}.$$To find the least integer $n$ that satisfies this inequality, we can use the fact that $n$ must be the smallest integer greater than or equal to $1000/(2.75 - problem/100)$. Simplifying this expression, we get $$n > frac{40000}{11 - 4(problem/100)}.$$Rounding up to the nearest integer, we find that the least number of widgets the company has to sell is $boxed{lceil 40000/(11 - 4(problem/100))rceil}$.", "simplifiedSolution": "lceil 40000/(11 - 4(problem/100))rceil"} Note: This response uses LaTeX code for the ceiling function, $lceil rceil$, which renders as $lceil x rceil$, where $x$ is some expression.

Continuing in this manner, we find $f(f(f(f(f(f(2)))))) = f(f(f(f(f(5)))))$. Since $5$ is odd, we have $f(5) = 5^2 + 1 = 26$, so $f(f(f(f(f(5))))) = f(f(f(f(26))))$. Since $26$ is even, we have $f(26) = 26^2 - 3cdot 26 + 1 = 625$, so $f(f(f(f(26)))) = f(f(f(625)))$. Since $625$ is odd, we have $f(625) = 625^2 + 1$, but we don't need to calculate this value, since we can simply note that any odd integer squared is $1$ more than a multiple of $8$ (which can be proven with modular arithmetic), so $625^2 + 1$ is $1$ more than a multiple of $8$, which means it is an even integer. Therefore, $f(625)$ is even, which means $f(f(f(625))) = f(625)^2 - 3f(625) + 1$. We already know that $f(625)$ is even, so we can write $f(f(f(625))) = (2k)^2 - 3(2k) + 1 = 4k^2 - 6k + 1 = 2(2k^2 - 3k) + 1$, where $k = f(625)/2$. Finally, we substitute $k$ into the expression $2(2k^2 - 3k) + 1$ to get $f(f(f(f(26)))) = f(f(f(625))) = 2(2(f(625)/2)^2 - 3(f(625)/2)) + 1 = boxed{244}".,    "simplifiedSolution":"244"}

Since each of the numbers 2 through 9 is used exactly once, we can set up an equation based on $s$: $$2 + 3 + 4 + x = 5 + 9 + y + z quad Rightarrow quad x = y + z - s + 2.$$Applying this same logic to each of the four small squares, we can express $z$ in terms of $s$: $$w = x + y - z = 2y + z - s quad Rightarrow quad z = frac{s-w+2y}{3}.$$If one of the numbers $w$ through $z$ is odd (namely, $w$), then another one of them must be even.  But since we're looking at expressions involving $y$ and $z$, which are both integers, this would be impossible if $s$ were odd.  Therefore, $s$ must be even.  At this point, we can try out some even sums.  Since a fair amount of structure exists within the square, we'll want $s$ to take advantage of this in some way.  Thus, we let $s = 2 + 9 = 5 + 8 = 6 + 7$, which yields the following solution: [asy]size(101);draw(unitsquare);draw(shift(up)*shift(right)*unitsquare);filldraw(shift(up)*unitsquare,gray(.6));filldraw(shift(right)*unitsquare,gray(.6));draw((0,0)--(2,2)^^(0,2)--(2,0));label("$5$", (1.5,1.5));label("$3$", (.5,1.5));label("$7$", (.5,.5));label("$6$", (1.5,.5));label("$2$", (3.5,1.5));label("$4$", (3.5,.5));label("$9$", (2.5,-.5));label("$8$", (1.5,-.5));[/asy]and so the desired sum is $boxed{11}$.",    "simplifiedSolution":"11"}

We can show this as such: $|(10x + y) - (10y + x)| = 27.$ However, it doesn't matter which of the two numbers is greater, since we wish to find their sum. So, without loss of generality, we will let the first number be the larger of the two. This means that $x > y,$ so we can get rid of the absolute values in our last equation to obtain $9x - 9y = 27,$ equivalent to $x - y = 3.$We now have two equations in two variables: $x + y = 13$ and $x - y = 3.$ Adding the two, we obtain $2x = 16,$ so $x = 8.$ Subtracting, we obtain $2y = 10,$ so $y = 5.$ Thus, the original number is $85.$ The number in which the digits are reversed is $58,$ and we have $85 + 58 = boxed{143}.$", which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.
