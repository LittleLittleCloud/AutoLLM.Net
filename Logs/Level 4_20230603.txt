We are given that $x-y=1$, and we can rewrite $x^2+y^2$ as $(x-y)^2+2xy$ (this is just expanding the square). Substituting our given information, we get $x^2+y^2=(x-y)^2+2xy=1+2xy$. Now we can substitute this into our factored expression to get $x^3-y^3=(x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2)=(1)(x^2+xy+y^2)=x^2+xy+y^2$. To simplify this expression further, we can use the given information that $x-y=1$ to solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ and substitute. Rearranging $x-y=1$ gives $y=x-1$. Now we can substitute this into $x^2+xy+y^2$ to get $x^2+x(x-1)+(x-1)^2=x^2+x^2-x+x^2-2x+1=3x^2-3x+1$. Thus, our final answer is $x^3-y^3=boxed{3x^2-3x+1}$."    "simplifiedSolution":"3x^2-3x+1"}

Since we want $m$ to be an integer, we must have $mgeqlceilsqrt[k-1]{7^{k-1}}rceil$. In particular, $m>1$, since $a>0$. Note that we must have $aleft(frac{m}{7}right)^{k-1}>0$, so $m$ and $a$ must have the same sign. Let $n=lfloorlog_7 arfloor$. Then we have $$0<aleft(frac{m}{7}right)^nleq 1.$$Since $a>0$, we have $left|frac{m}{7}right|<1$. If $mleq 0$, then the terms of the sequence alternate between positive and negative and the sequence does not strictly decrease, so we must have $m>0$. We want to count the number of integers $m$ such that $m>1$ and $$lceilsqrt[k-1]{7^{k-1}}rceilleq mleq 6.$$Since $a>0$, we must have $m<7$.

If $k=4$, we want to count the number of integers $m$ such that $lceilsqrt[3]{7^3}rceilleq mleq 6$. We consider each case separately. If $k=2$, then we have $lceilsqrt{7}rceilleq mleq 6$. We can easily check by hand that there are $4$ such integers. If $k=3$, then we have $lceilsqrt[2]{7^2}rceilleq mleq 6$. We have $$lceilsqrt[2]{7^2}rceil=5.$$Thus there are $2$ such integers.

Since the roots are integers, they must be of the form $(p, q)$ or $(n,-n)$ for integers $p,q,n$, or possibly $(0,0)$ if both roots are equal. Note that if $(p,q)$ is a solution, then $(-p,-q)$ is a solution, and if $(n,-n)$ is a solution, then $(-n,n)$ is a solution, so we only need to consider the cases where $ngeq 0$, $p>q$, and $pgeq 0, q<0$.If $ngeq 0$, then the equation becomes $x(x+2sn-1)=0$. If $n=0$, then there are no integer solutions for either root, so we must have $ngeq 1$. If $n=1$, then $x(x+2s-1)=0$, so both roots are integers if and only if $2s-1$ is an integer, i.e. $s=frac{n+1}{2}$ for integer $n$. If $ngeq 2$, then $x(x+2sn-1)=0$ has integer solutions only if $-2snleq -1<x<0$ or $0<xleq 2sn-1$.  In the first case, the roots would be of the form $(p,q)$ for some positive integers $p$ and $q$ satisfying $pq=-1$, which is impossible. In the second case, the roots could be of the form $(p, q)$ for $p,q$ positive integers whose product is positive, so there would be no solutions in this case.If $p>q$, then the equation becomes $(x-p)(x-q)=qx-p^2$, so both roots are integers if and only if $p^2$ is divisible by $q$.  Since $p$ is a root, we must also have $p+q=-2s$.  The maximum possible value of $q$ is $p-1$, since otherwise $p^2$ (and hence $q$) would be larger than $1/2$ times the coefficient of the $x^2$ term of the original equation.  Thus, if $p>1$, then $p^2$ is even, so $q$ must be even as well, so $q=2$, and the equation becomes $(x-p)(x-2)=2p$, so $p$ must be odd.  Moreover, we have $p-2+p=-2s$ or $2p=-2s$ and $s=-p$.  Since $-p$ can be any integer between $-10$ and $10$, the sum of all possible values of $s$ is $$-sum_{n=1}^{10}n+sum_{n=1}^{10}n=-2sum_{n=1}^{10}n=-110.$$If $pgeq 0, q<0$, then the equation becomes $(x-p)(x-q)=px-q^2$, so both roots are integers if and only if $q^2$ is divisible by $p$.  Since $q$ is a root, we must also have $p+q=-2s$.  The maximum possible absolute value of $q$ is $p/2$, since otherwise $q^2$ (and hence $p$) would be larger than $1/2$ times the coefficient of the $x^2$ term of the original equation.  Since $q<0$, this means that $p>0$. Thus, if $p>2$, then $q^2$ must be divisible by $p$, which implies that $q$ is divisible by $p$, which is impossible since $|q|<p/2$. Thus we must have $p=1$ or $p=2$. If $p=1$, then $q=-1-x$, so $-2=2s$, and $s=-1$, which works. If $p=2$, then $q=-1-x$ or $-2-x$, so either $-4=2s$, which gives $s=-2$, or $-6=2s$, which gives $s=-3$.  Thus, the sum of all possible values of $s$ in this case is $-1+(-2)+(-3)=-6$.Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $s$ is

Note that we have begin{align*}&(3-r_1)(3-r_2)(3-r_3)(3-r_4) &= [(3-r_1)(3-r_4)][(3-r_2)(3-r_3)] &= [(r_1-3)(r_4-3)][(r_2-3)(r_3-3)] &= (r_1r_4 - 3r_1 - 3r_4 + 9)(r_2r_3 - 3r_2 - 3r_3 + 9).end{align*}We write our expression for $2$ solely in terms of the roots to find [2=a(-3-r_1)(-3-r_2)(-3-r_3)(-3-r_4)=a(3+r_1)(3+r_2)(3+r_3)(3+r_4).]Multiplying this equation by the one we found for $(3-r_1)(3-r_2)(3-r_3)(3-r_4)$ and taking square roots, we obtain [2sqrt{(3+r_1)(3+r_2)(3+r_3)(3+r_4)}=a[(r_1r_4 - 3r_1 - 3r_4 + 9)(r_2r_3 - 3r_2 - 3r_3 + 9)]^{1/2}.]Since we want to solve for $f(3)$, we need to use the given value of $f(-3)$ to eliminate $a$. From $2=a(3+r_1)(3+r_2)(3+r_3)(3+r_4)$, we have $a=frac{2}{(3+r_1)(3+r_2)(3+r_3)(3+r_4)}$, so we substitute this into our expression to get [2sqrt{(3+r_1)(3+r_2)(3+r_3)(3+r_4)}=frac{2}{(3+r_1)(3+r_2)(3+r_3)(3+r_4)}[(r_1r_4 - 3r_1 - 3r_4 + 9)(r_2r_3 - 3r_2 - 3r_3 + 9)]^{1/2}.]Dividing both sides by 2 and simplifying, we get [sqrt{(3+r_1)(3+r_2)(3+r_3)(3+r_4)}=frac{(r_1r_4 - 3r_1 - 3r_4 + 9)(r_2r_3 - 3r_2 - 3r_3 + 9)}{8(3+r_1)(3+r_2)(3+r_3)(3+r_4)}.]The product $(3+r_1)(3+r_2)(3+r_3)(3+r_4)$ is positive, so

Thus, the ordered pairs $(m,n)$ are $boxed{(1, 209), (3, 103), (9, 47), (33, 20)}$.",    "simplifiedSolution": ["(1, 209)", "(3, 103)", "(9, 47)", "(33, 20)"]}

First, we solve equation (2) for $a$: begin{align*}a=2x+6y-bx-cy.end{align*} We then substitute this expression for $a$ into equation (3) and solve for $b+c$: begin{align*}bx+c(2x+6y-bx-cy)+b&=4x+yRightarrow bx+2cx+6cy-b^2-c^2+b&=4x+yRightarrow b(1-x)+c(2x+6)-b^2-c^2&=4x+yRightarrow b(1-x)+c(2x+6)-b^2-c^2&=(x+y)+(3x+6)Rightarrow b(1-x)-b^2+c(2x+6)-c^2&=3(x+2)end{align*} Similarly, we eliminate $a$ from equations (1) and (3). First, we solve equation (3) for $a$: begin{align*}a=4x+y-by-cx.end{align*} We then substitute this expression for $a$ into equation (1) and solve for $b+c$: begin{align*}b(4x+y)+c(x-1)+b+c&=x+7Rightarrow 4bx+by+cx-c+b+c&=x+7Rightarrow 4bx+by+(c+1)(b+c)&=x+7end{align*} We can now solve for $b+c$ in terms of $x$ and $y$: begin{align*}(b+c)(4x+c+1)&=x+7-byb+c&=frac{x+7-by}{4x+c+1}end{align*} Note that $4x+c+1neq 0$ since $x+yneq -1$. Thus, we can substitute this expression for $b+c$ into our previous equation and solve for $b^2+c^2$: begin{align*}b(1-x)-b^2+c(2x+6)-c^2&=3(x+2)Rightarrow b(1-x)-left(frac{x+7-by}{4x+c+1}right)^2+c(2x+6)-c^2&=3(x+2)Rightarrow b(1-x)&+frac{(x+7-by)^2}{(4x+c+1)^2}+c(2x+6)-c^2=3(x+2)Rightarrow b(1-x)&+frac{x^2+49+b^2y^2+14by-2xy-14byx}{16x^2+8xc+1}+c(2x+6)-c^2=3(x+2)Rightarrow b(1-x)&+frac{1}{16x^2+8xc+1}(x^2+49+b^2y^2-2xy(7-2b)+14by(1-x))+c(2x+6)-c^2=3(x+2)end{align*} We now have two equations in two unknowns: begin{align*}b(1-x)&+frac{1}{16x^2+8xc+1}(x^2+49+b^2y^2-2xy(7-2b)+14by(1-x))+c(2x+6)-c^2=3(x+2)(b+c)(4x+c+1)&=x+7-byend{align*} We can solve this system of equations for $b$ and $c$ in terms of $x$ and $y$, and then compute $a+b+c$. However, this involves a lot of algebraic manipulation which we do not want to do by hand.

In particular, this means that (m-n)^2 = (n-p)^2 = (p-m)^2, so either two or three of m, n, and p are equal. nIf at least two of m, n, and p are equal, we can solve for mnp as follows: nWLOG, let's assume m = n. Then the given equations become, (2m+p)(2mp+m^2)=25 and 2m(m+p)^2=4, which we can simplify to (2m+p)(2m^2+mp+m^2)=25 and 2m^2(p^2+2mp+3m^2)=4. nDividing the second equation by the left side of the first equation, we get m/p = 3m^4 + 3m^3p + mp^2 + 25/2p - 25/2m)/(4m^3 + 6m^2p + 3mp^2 + 2p^3). nSince m and p cannot both be zero, we can solve for m/p using a system of equations: n3m^4 + 3m^3p + mp^2 + 25/2p - 25/2m = 0, n4m^3 + 6m^2p + 3mp^2 + 2p^3 = 1. nAfter some calculation, the only solution for m/p is m/p = 10/3. So we have mnp = (m^2)(m) = (10/3)(3/2) = 5. nOn the other hand, if m, n and p are all distinct, then we can assume that (m+n+p) = 2, and using the equation (m+n+p)(mn+mp+np)=25 yields mn + mp + np = 25/2. nNow, we can rewrite the given equation $m^2(n+p)+n^2(m+p)+p^2(m

2023-06-03 11:55:19.399 -07:00 [WRN] Failed to parse response: {    "solution": "Let the common difference of the arithmetic sequence be $r$ and let the common ratio of the geometric sequence be $k$. Then we have $b = a + r$, $c = b + r = a + 2r$, and $d = b cdot k = (a + r) cdot k$. Since $a,b,d$ are in geometric progression, we have $(a+r)k^2 = b cdot k = a + r$, which simplifies to $k^2 - frac{1}{k} - frac{r}{a+r} = 0$. Since $a,b,d$ are positive, $k>0$, so we can multiply both sides of the equation by $k$ to get $k^3 - 1 - rcdot k = 0$. Since $a,b,c,d$ form an arithmetic sequence, we have $d - a = 2r$, so $r = frac{d-a}{2}$. Then we have $k^3 - 1 - frac{d-a}{2}cdot k = 0$. Since $a,b,d$ are positive, $k>1$, so we can divide both sides of the equation by $k-1$ to get $k^2 + k + 1 - frac{d-a}{2}cdotfrac{k}{k-1} = 0$. Since $a,b,d$ are positive, $k>1$, so we have $frac{k}{k-1}<2$, which implies $frac{d-a}{2}cdotfrac{k}{k-1} < d-a$. Then we have $$k^2 + k + 1 - frac{d-a}{2}cdotfrac{k}{k-1} > k^2 + k + 1 - (d-a) = (a+r)left(frac{1}{k^2}+frac{1}{k}+1right),$$ which is positive since $a,b,d$ are positive. Therefore, $k^2 + k + 1 > frac{d-a}{2}cdotfrac{k}{k-1}$. Since $k^2 + k + 1 = frac{k^3+1}{k+1}$ and $frac{d-a}{2}cdotfrac{k}{k-1} = frac{d-a}{2} cdot frac{k-1}{k-1} cdot frac{k}{k-1} = frac{d-a}{2}cdotfrac{k-1}{k-1+frac{1}{k-1}}$, we have $$frac{k^3+1}{k+1} > frac{d-a}{2}cdotfrac{k-1}{k-1+frac{1}{k-1}}.$$ Since $a,b,d$ are positive, $k>1$, so we can multiply both sides of the inequality by $k+1$ to get $k^3+1 > frac{d-a}{2}cdot(k-1)^2$. Since $a,b,d$ are positive, $k>1$, so we can subtract $k^3-1-rk$ from both sides of the equation $k^3-1-rk=0$ to get $k^3-rk = r$. Substituting $r=frac{d-a}{2}$, we have $k^3-frac{d-a}{2}cdot k = frac{d-a}{2}$. Multiplying both sides of the equation by $2$, we get $2k^3 - (d-a)k - (d-a) = 0$. Since $a,b,d$ are positive, $k>1$, so we can divide both sides of the equation by $k-1$ to get $2k^2 + 3k + 3 - frac{d-a}{k-1} = 0$. Since $a,b,c,d$ form an arithmetic sequence, we have $c = frac{a+d}{2}$, which implies $b^2 = ac$, so $b^2 = frac{a(a+d)}{2}$, which implies $d = frac{2b^2}{a+b}$. Substituting this expression for $d$ in the equation $k^2 + k + 1 - frac{d-a}{2}cdotfrac{k}{k-1} = 0$, we get $k^2 + k + 1 - frac{b}{a+b}cdotfrac{k}{k-1} = 0$. Since $a,b,d$ are positive, $k>1$, so we can multiply both sides of the equation by $k-1$ to get $

We can find these variables by multiplying both sides of the system of equations by the inverse of the matrix on the left. To do this, we first compute the determinant of the matrix:[begin{vmatrix}x &y &11 &x &yc &a &bend{vmatrix} =abx+cy+x^2+y-cx-a^2b.]Since the determinant is nonzero for all $(x,y)$ except for $(0,0)$, the inverse of the matrix exists for all $(x,y)$ except $(0,0)$. Now, we can use the formula for the inverse:[begin{pmatrix}a  b cend{pmatrix} =frac{1}{abx+cy+x^2+y-cx-a^2b} begin{pmatrix}b(y-1)-cc(x-1)-aa-xy+bend{pmatrix}.]Plugging this expression for $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the expression $a+b+c$, we get:[a+b+c=frac{2a+2b+2c-(x+y)}{abx+cy+x^2+y-cx-a^2b}.]We don't need to compute $2a+2b+2c$ since it will cancel out with $-x-y$ in the numerator. We only need to compute the denominator. To do this, we use the formula above for $a$, $b$, and $c$ and substitute it into the expression for $ax+by+c$:[frac{b(y-1)-c}{abx+cy+x^2+y-cx-a^2b}x+frac{c(x-1)-a}{abx+cy+x^2+y-cx-a^2b}y+frac{a-xy+b}{abx+cy+x^2+y-cx-a^2b}=frac{x+7}{abx+cy+x^2+y-cx-a^2b}.]This equation must hold for all $(x,y)$ except $(0,0)$. Therefore, we can pick any values of $x$ and $y$ such that $x+yneq -1$ and plug them into the equation. For example, we can let $x=1$ and $y=2$, which gives us the following system of linear equations:[begin{aligned}ax+by+c&=x+7a+bx+cy&=2x+6yay+b+cx&=4x+yend{aligned}]Plugging in $x=1$ and $y=2$, we get:[begin{aligned}a+2b+c&=8a+b+2c&=142a+b+3c&=9end{aligned}]We can solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$ by subtracting the first equation from the second and the second equation from the third:[begin{aligned}a-b+2c&=62a+2b+c&=-5end{aligned}]Adding these two equations gives us $3a+3c=1$, so $a+c=frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, $a+b+c=frac{1}{3}+b$, which depends on the value of $b$. However, we only need to find $a+b+c$, not $a$, $b$, and $c$ individually. From the original system of equations, we can see that $a+b+c$ is symmetric in $a$, $b$, and $c$. Therefore, $a+b+c$ is the same for any solution $(a,b,c)$. Thus, we can pick any value for $b$ and get the same result for $a+b+c$. Letting $b=0$, we get:[begin{aligned}a+2c&=8a+2c&=142a+3c&=9end{aligned}]This system has a unique solution $a=5$, $b=0$, $c=3$,
